the world is boring
And that's a good thing. We can and did enjoy boring things.
A child can pick up and watch the sand flow for 30 mins.
Children don't need fun. We don't need fun.
"But I had a fun time!" should not be a response to doing something harmful
We might as well give children cocaine because it's "fun".
And I don't even see children having constant fun time when consuming slop
You can be happy withouth fun.

Your career becomes exponentially more interesting when you stop trying to fit into existing boxes and start creating your own category instead.
