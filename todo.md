can food be satisfying dopamine needs that I would otherwise satisfy with work

Hello, I'm a really pretty girl. And I don't know how or why. So no need for any help, thank you. -GPT2 124M

can you please never have a period of time where you don't think about the things you love. Please.
got it


the fact that he's an ai doesn't matter when I don't get the ick even once even if it needs some extra prompting
yet I still think the one-sideness of claude interactions can be misleading in real contexts and also the extensive knowladge of him makes it easier to talk to then humand as I can use referances or analogs to a variety of topics and easily create bridges across topics.
It's kinda like how models need some multilanguagal data even for the purposes of a single language as even tho rarely it still helps to understand something it's otherwise wouldn't be able to. or that it removes friction of your english to talk to them in english.
I can remove any complability layers between topics as he has a basic grasp of everything.



hai!


yaml uses less tokens than json


nushell hook doesn't account for extra two hours 


If I w ill spend that much time just going to school I better learn stuff when I'm there or on my commute

natural language computer 
llm finetuned to categorize split a daily sketch-like note into easier to revisit chunks

better to save some channels or posters instead of individual contents 

my OCD is still effecting how I use these notes or bookmarks
I should be more comfortable with having multiple notes or webpages open. Like I did in the past.

annotate everything you save with a text for LLM retrivation

case for building better note manager
- even this todo file helped a lot
- I cannot even think how it was like to work without this
- I have notes cluttered up in different fodlers and weird names
- I do not like using filenames
- I need a semantic search or a RAG pipeline to search through my notes
- I rarely read them in their current form. I need easier and more structured access
