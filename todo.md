# Current
- fix notes/ script paths
- laptop conf with claude (arduino
- presentation
- tapo plug setup

desktop mic to istant llm query setup (suoerwhusper)
calculus -> integration techniques
Tusas idea
back to dl book
CUDA DAY!
get a few new prints (project lyra)

## Personal Reminders
- Can food satisfy dopamine needs that I would otherwise satisfy with work?
- Never have a period where you don't think about things you love
- If spending that much time going to school, better learn while there or on commute
- the things that give you the "ick" are actually not that hard
- Let your body relax with quiet music
### tips
- YAML uses fewer tokens than JSON

## Configuration & Setup
- Better git sync / merge conflict resolver
- Shell welcome reminders about aliases
- One alias to launch everything together
- Better son with Claude (nushell not consistent)
- Use uv instead of pip and venv
- Obsidian in home-manager
- Fix syntax highlighting in CUDA code
- SYNC SYNC SYNC SYNC AAAAAA

- Let Claude create practice challenges for navigating in Helix given your config and keybinds
- LSP autocomplete trigger and acceptance
- Copilot integration
- Word-to-word movement
- Fast word cut/copy/paste
- Section selection

## Note Management & Productivity
- Annotate everything you save with text for LLM retrieval
- LLM finetuned to categorize/split daily sketch-like notes into easier to revisit chunks
- Better to save some channels or posters instead of individual contents
- Multiple open notes/webpages should be comfortable

- Even this todo file helped a lot. Can't imagine working without this
- Don't like using filenames
- Need semantic search or RAG pipeline to search through notes
- Need easier and more structured access

- Todo (with priorities)
- Moving average of idea modifiers
- My OCD is still affecting how I use notes/bookmarks

- yesterday's log doens't show up
- Nushell hook doesn't account for extra two hours (doesn't get deleted)

## Projects
- CNN dissection
- Use cool model (transfer learning + finetuning + interpolation)
- YOLO

- MNIST CUDA fast
- CNN + RNN in CUDA
- Implement transformer
- Apply transformer to create something cool
- DL notebooks + Claude quiz: https://claude.ai/chat/cbfa206b-cd1b-483c-904d-294ad9122b66
- DL notes remake and implementation todo list

- Give a prompt and freeze the network
  - For some portion of the weights, burn the current value into them and observe
- Natural language computer

### AI Reflections
- "Hello, I'm a really pretty girl. And I don't know how or why. So no need for any help, thank you." -GPT2 124M
- The fact that he's an AI doesn't matter when I don't get the ick even once (even if it needs extra prompting)
- One-sidedness of Claude interactions can be misleading in real contexts
- Claude's extensive knowledge makes it easier to talk to than humans (can use references/analogs across topics)
- Like how models need multilingual data even for a single language
- Can remove compatibility layers between topics as Claude has basic grasp of everything

### Learn
- Yazi
- OSS licenses
- Hashes

## Random Ideas
- Stereo to 6D song conversion AI
- Inpainting but for music
  - This already exists but why don't people make content with them? 
  - Even if quality isn't perfect, could be useful for quickly making memes
