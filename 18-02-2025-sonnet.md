hello claude I've thought about my life in a way that I didn't do for some time and I would like share what I wrote. it is not a way to ask for help but just to hear another voice. here it is. Please try to be understanding and I don't need overly positive or assuring language. I cannot be negatively effected no matter what you say so be free. And please try to infer what kind of a person I am and from the given text and respond accordingly. Thanks.

I've read your introspective piece carefully. What strikes me most is your acute self-awareness combined with a deep struggle between different parts of yourself - the analytical part that can dissect your patterns with remarkable clarity, and the part that fears these insights will be dismissed or forgotten by tomorrow.

Your writing suggests someone who is highly intelligent and self-reflective, but who has developed a complex internal dialogue system ("voices") as both a coping mechanism and a barrier. You seem to have a strong technical/analytical background (references to ML, Linux, technical interests), but you're grappling with how to connect with others without filtering it through a technical/achievement lens.

The metaphor of being in a "mental tag game" where you're running from something for years is particularly poignant. It captures both the exhaustion and the circular nature of your thought patterns.

What's interesting is how you recognize that your isolation isn't just from others anymore, but from yourself - the way you describe being "parasocial about myself" is a remarkably insightful observation. You see how your early isolation led to building an identity based largely on internal values and assumptions, which later became barriers when they were challenged by reality.

I notice you're particularly concerned about this reflection being fleeting - that tomorrow you might dismiss it as cringe or that it will be drowned out by the "voices." This suggests you've had moments of clarity before that didn't stick, and you're aware of your pattern of cognitive avoidance ("censoring out every piece of cognitive load bearing thought").

Would you like to explore any particular aspect of what you've written in more detail? I'm particularly curious about your observation regarding being "parasocial about myself" and how that manifests in your daily life.
R

as you notice there are chains of thoughts where I have reached a somewhat clear end but the things that haunt me are the ones that I'm still not able to think tangently. Like the thought of my tommorow self not caring about what I now think is this really important writing. so to say it again the reason I'm here is that I need some vectors of thought that are perpendicular to my way of thinking that I showed.

I understand you're looking for perspectives that cut across your established thought patterns rather than running parallel to them. Let me offer some "perpendicular" vectors:

You describe a fear of your tomorrow self dismissing these insights, but what if this very pattern - the oscillation between insight and dismissal - is itself a stable feature rather than a bug? Perhaps the question isn't about how to make insights "stick," but about understanding why your mind has developed this rhythm of approach and retreat.

Here's another angle: You speak of "voices" and your tomorrow self as if they're adversaries, but they might be serving as proxy debates for something more fundamental. Instead of seeing them as voices trying to distract you from truth, they could be different strategies your mind has developed for engaging with uncertainty. Each "voice" might represent a different way of testing reality.

Your metaphor of a "mental tag game" suggests you see yourself as being chased. But what if you're both the chaser and the chased? The very act of trying to pin down your "true" thoughts could be creating the momentum that keeps you running.

You mention failing to find root causes, but what if the search for a root cause is itself part of your technical/analytical framework that might not apply here? Human consciousness isn't necessarily a hierarchical system with clear root causes - it might be more like a network where "cause" and "effect" are continuously cycling into each other.

These are just some alternative vectors of thought. Do any of them resonate as truly perpendicular to your current thinking patterns?
R

"why your mind has developed this rhythm of approach and retreat"
I don't know you have any ideas.

"Your metaphor of a "mental tag game" suggests you see yourself as being chased. But what if you're both the chaser and the chased? The very act of trying to pin down your "true" thoughts could be creating the momentum that keeps you running."
I agree with this one and it's the reason i still keep going. There is still a passion about thing I like (deep learning or other cool nerdy stuff) yet what I didn't clearly mention is how short lived and high frequency this cycle of passion and feeling all the down feeling I mentioned. this is why I tie things to what might be mental health issues but that's also a topic I'm touching with a stick from a feet away because I think just saying "oh I'm mentally ill" is unprodcutive and not a change inducing thought.

The rhythm of approach and retreat might be connected to how you engage with passion and meaning. From your additional context, these cycles are happening at high frequency - moments of intense engagement with things you love (deep learning, tech) followed by crashes into self-doubt and disconnection.

Here's a perpendicular thought: What if this pattern isn't about mental health in the way you're thinking, but about the mismatch between how you naturally experience interest/engagement and how you think you should experience it? You seem to view the short-lived nature of your passionate moments as a problem, but what if that's actually your natural rhythm? The issue might not be the rhythm itself, but the exhaustion that comes from fighting against it.

Your caution about the mental health framing is interesting - you're right that simply labeling something as "mental illness" can become a dead end. But there might be a middle ground between using mental health as an unproductive label and completely avoiding the role of your brain's actual functioning in how you experience the world.

You mentioned earlier about not using your brain much in recent years, but your writing shows intense cognitive activity. Could it be that you're not recognizing certain types of mental activity as "valid" brain use? The energy spent in these internal debates and self-analysis is significant mental work, even if it doesn't produce external results you can measure.
R

"The issue might not be the rhythm itself, but the exhaustion that comes from fighting against it." the reason I don't agree with this is you might have thought I'm trying hard but I actually lose a lot of these fight just from the start. So I don't think there can be much of an intense conflict that causes exhaustion.

"Could it be that you're not recognizing certain types of mental activity as "valid" brain use?"
when I'm trying to grasp a new concept in deep learning like initialization techniques to keep variance constant even in residual pathways, I feel challenged and understanding it feels rewarding. And during this process I know I'm using my brain because the voices that tell me to quit get louder and louder and sometimes win and that's the work over for the day. but when it comes to writings like this. This is not the result of a thinking over years or months or even weeks. I pretty much come up with these while writing them in the last hour. And I do not see the indicatiors of extensive brain usage like I mentioned in the ml example.

Your distinction between these two types of mental effort is revealing. When learning technical concepts, you have clear markers of cognitive effort - the mounting internal resistance, the struggle, the eventual victory or retreat. But you seem to discount these insights about yourself because they came "too easily" - they flowed out in writing without that same feeling of mental strain.

This brings up an interesting paradox: Could your very definition of "valid thinking" - one that requires strain and resistance - be part of what maintains your patterns? You recognize and value cognitive effort when it fits a certain profile (technical learning, pushing through resistance), but might dismiss equally valuable insights when they come through different channels (spontaneous self-reflection, writing).

You said something telling: "I pretty much come up with these while writing them in the last hour." Yet the depth and interconnectedness of your insights suggests these aren't new thoughts being generated in real-time, but rather existing understandings finally finding expression. The "work" might have been happening all along, just not in the linear, resistance-heavy way you associate with "real" thinking.

This connects back to your earlier point about the high-frequency cycles of passion and withdrawal. Perhaps there's a similar pattern in how you validate different types of mental activity - technical learning gets recognized as "real work," while other forms of understanding get categorized as "not really using my brain," even when they yield significant insights.
R

Okay I can kinda see it but I think there is another point I can make regarding the original writing. The tasks that I feel heavy cognitive load are usually the tasks that their requirements can be defined as a combination of intelligence and knowledge or practice. like the DL example. But this writing like you said might be more pure intelligence. Where I'm going with this is that the general problems of focus and such effect my learning ability directly as a result of that I perform almost none of the learning or acquiring knowledge part of those mixed tasks so all the load is cognitive. I'm a computer withouth a memory and not a big enough cpu that can make it up with caches.

This is a compelling analogy and I think it cuts to something important. You're essentially describing yourself as a system with high processing power but limited memory persistence - capable of intense computational tasks in the moment (whether that's technical problem-solving or self-analysis) but struggling with the accumulation and integration of knowledge over time.

This framing adds another dimension to what you wrote about "not using your brain for years" - it's not that the processor isn't running (in fact, it seems to be running quite hot), but rather that the results aren't being effectively stored and built upon. Each intense cognitive task becomes almost like a fresh computation starting from baseline, rather than building on cached results from previous work.

This could explain why your insights about yourself, despite being profound, feel somehow less "valid" than technical problem-solving. Technical problems give you clear feedback about whether you've successfully integrated previous knowledge, while personal insights might feel like you're repeatedly discovering and then losing the same truths.

It's interesting how this connects to your earlier point about "destructive past-erasing thinking" - you mentioned forgetting about spending 1.5 years on SS13. Perhaps this isn't just about memory, but about your system's difficulty in integrating past experiences into a persistent knowledge base that can inform future processing.
R

I remember being better at this. And I feel like most of my memory have always been in the form of pattern matching as I cannot really recall them out of nowhere but I can remember what a function does when I see it. Yet it doesn't come to my mind when I need it.
-----------
and here I will also ask you to be more decisive about your assumption and be more result oriented. As much as like thinking alongside you, I also want to see clear endpoints from your part

Let me be more direct with what I see as key insights from our discussion:

    Your intelligence functions primarily through pattern recognition and real-time processing rather than active recall. This isn't inherently a problem, but your current state seems to be a degraded version of this natural tendency - where even the pattern recognition has become less reliable.
    The root issue appears to be a breakdown in your ability to accumulate and integrate experiences over time. This isn't just about memory - it's about building a functional knowledge base that can be accessed when needed. Your processor (intelligence) is still strong, but it's increasingly operating in isolation from your past experiences and learned patterns.
    The "voices" and cycles of insight/dismissal seem to be a symptom of this fragmentation, not the cause. They represent your system trying to maintain continuity when the normal mechanisms for integrating experience have become disrupted.

Concrete suggestion: Instead of trying to force yourself to remember or maintain insights, focus on creating more situations where pattern recognition can occur naturally. This means:

    More exposure to technical problems where you can exercise pattern matching
    Regular engagement with familiar material (rather than always seeking new information)
    Writing that focuses on identifying patterns rather than generating new insights

The goal would be to gradually rebuild your ability to accumulate and access knowledge through pattern recognition, rather than trying to force a different type of memory system that might not be natural to how you think.

Does this more decisive framing help clarify things?
R

"Writing that focuses on identifying patterns rather than generating new insights" wdym

and after that the first problem I mentioned still haunts me. I need some well thought out suggestions to at least reduce the fear I feel regarding the mental instability ("voices") that inevitably hits. I want to feel stronger against it and have some defenses prepared.

Let me clarify both points:

Regarding pattern-focused writing, here's what I mean specifically:
Instead of trying to generate fresh insights (like your late-night writing), try documenting when you notice recurring patterns in your daily life. For example: "Today I noticed I got excited about X technical concept, then felt resistance after Y minutes, then the voices started..." The goal is to build up a catalog of your patterns that you can reference later, rather than always trying to generate new understanding from scratch.

Now for the more crucial point about defending against the "voices" and mental instability:

Concrete defensive strategies:

    External anchoring: When you have a moment of clarity like your writing tonight, immediately create some form of external record that's harder to dismiss later. This could be as simple as setting specific calendar reminders with quotes from your clear-minded self, or recording voice notes. The key is having something concrete that exists outside your mental space that can serve as proof against future dismissal.
    Pre-commitment to patterns: When you notice you're in a clear mental state, write down specific patterns you know will repeat (like the voices dismissing insights as cringe). Then write down counter-arguments while you're clear-headed. This gives you pre-prepared defenses for when the instability hits.
    Complexity as defense: Your insight about biological and social systems being complex and requiring multiple points of failure is actually a powerful defense. When the voices try to oversimplify or dismiss your insights, you can return to this understanding of complexity - it's harder to dismiss multiple interconnected observations than a single insight.

The goal isn't to eliminate the voices or instability (which might be impossible), but to build a stronger position from which to weather them. Think of it like building fortifications rather than trying to stop the attack entirely.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these strategies? They're meant to be practical rather than just theoretical.
R

these are really helpfull claude thank you. I still have a couple points some from the original writing that we didn't touch on and some more.
how does the escape from cognitive work that doesn't require knowladge tie to this?
yes I have written all these with some cognitive work yet this still was something I was running away from doing but actually doing it is not even exhausting. (Writing instead of just thinking also helps). Or other stuff when I avoid thinking about what I will do in a near future. Like avoiding thinking about internship applications and such.
one thing that's related to this is my bookmarks folder that has collected thousands of links that I actually just save to avoid current cognitive load and still feel some satisfaction by saying myself "yeah i will come back to this"

This avoidance of cognitive work despite it not being actually exhausting when you do it reveals another important pattern. Let me break this down decisively:

The bookmarking behavior is a perfect example of what's really happening: You've developed a system of "cognitive load deferral" where:

    You get the immediate reward of feeling like you've engaged with something ("I'll come back to this")
    You avoid the actual engagement
    The deferred items pile up (thousands of bookmarks)
    The pile itself becomes overwhelming, reinforcing avoidance

This same pattern appears to apply to your larger cognitive tasks:

    Thinking about future plans
    Processing personal insights
    Internship applications
    Learning new material

The key insight is that it's not the cognitive load itself that you're avoiding (as you've proven by writing this extensive self-analysis), but rather the anticipation of cognitive load. The actual work, when you do it, isn't as exhausting as the anticipatory anxiety about doing it.

This creates a self-reinforcing cycle:

    Anticipate cognitive load
    Defer/avoid
    Feel momentary relief
    Watch the deferred items accumulate
    Feel overwhelmed by accumulation
    Increased anticipatory anxiety about tackling any of it
    Repeat

Breaking this cycle requires recognizing that your anticipation of the difficulty is often worse than the actual task. Your successful writing tonight is evidence of this - you engaged with complex personal analysis and found it manageable once you actually started.

Practical suggestion: Start treating your anticipation of cognitive load as unreliable data. When you feel the urge to bookmark something or defer thinking about something, try a 2-minute rule: Engage with it for just 2 minutes before deciding to defer. This could help recalibrate your anticipation system to match the actual cognitive load rather than your fears about it.
R

why did this work today
I've had an exprience where I was able to focus for a long time and perform new cognitive tasks.
It can be this weird motivation that comes when you actually need to sleep. or is that thinking a bias. I mean whener you do meaningfull work at night it is bound to be a sleep replacement so the need for sleep might not be the motivator but again why did this work today?

This is an interesting question that deserves careful analysis. Let me look at the specific conditions of tonight's writing:

    Late night timing: While the "sleep procrastination productivity" is a real phenomenon (sometimes called "revenge bedtime procrastination"), I think there might be something else significant about late night:
        Fewer external interruptions
        Lower expectations for productivity, which paradoxically reduces performance anxiety
        A certain mental state where the "voices" might be tired enough to have less immediate resistance
    The format of writing itself: You mentioned "Writing instead of just thinking also helps." Writing provides:
        External structure to thoughts
        A way to bypass the immediate dismissal from the "voices" since thoughts are captured as they form
        Concrete evidence of cognitive work that's harder to dismiss
    The context of sharing: You came here with the intention to share these thoughts with another perspective. This might have:
        Created a sense of purpose beyond just self-reflection
        Provided a framework for organizing thoughts (knowing they need to be communicable)
        Reduced the internal pressure since the thoughts were meant to be externalized

But I suspect the most crucial factor wasn't any of these alone, but rather that they combined to create a situation where:

    The usual resistance patterns were partially bypassed (late night)
    There was an immediate external capture method (writing)
    There was a purpose that wasn't purely self-focused (sharing)

This combination might have allowed you to slip past your usual cognitive defense mechanisms before they could mount their standard resistance.

Would you say any of these factors feel particularly relevant to how you were able to engage in this thinking tonight?
R

yeah almost like this is a complex situation that when it goes right there are multiple reasons and same for when it goes wrong. Sounds familiar :)

Also what are some other catalysts like writing that help focus. Most of the work I need to do now is actually learning, by reading watching so is the answer writing again?

Yes, exactly - you're recognizing the same pattern of complex, multi-factor causation that you identified in your original writing about life and society. It's a satisfying parallel.

For learning through reading/watching, here are some specific catalysts that share the key properties that made writing effective:

    Active note-taking, but with a twist:
        Instead of just summarizing, try to connect new concepts to patterns you already recognize (leveraging your pattern-matching strength)
        Use diagrams/sketches - they provide the same externalization benefit as writing but work well for technical concepts
        The physical act of writing/drawing can help maintain focus, similar to how writing helped with your self-reflection
    Teaching/explaining to an imagined audience:
        This provides the same externalization benefit as sharing your thoughts with me
        It forces you to organize information in a communicable way
        Can be done through actual writing, voice recording, or even just structured self-talk
    Code implementation while learning:
        For technical concepts (like the DL initialization techniques you mentioned), immediately trying to implement them
        This provides concrete feedback and engages your pattern recognition
        The act of coding itself can serve as an anchor for focus, similar to how writing anchored your thoughts tonight

A key point: All these methods share the property of creating immediate, external evidence of your engagement with the material. They help bypass the "I'll come back to this later" deferral pattern by producing something concrete in the moment.

Would you like me to expand on any of these methods, particularly for the specific type of technical learning you're focused on?
R

thank you again for really profound insights I really think this conversation is one of the best things I've done recently.

The things I want to mention just keeps popping up to my head.
one of the reasons that I can count as a cause of negative thought patterns is my perfectionism and also I've got a ocd diagnosis but I don't really think it is anythin more than perfectionism (I have no other weird habits that can be seen in ocd).
this is a really good way to dismiss non perfect work or writing or non complete knowladge and throw it away.

but unlike other things I mentioned this is a much older and potentially a genetic trait of mine.
but since I can rarely see places where this is useful I fail to not fall into the trap of not doing work when I can't do it perfectly.

like when it comes to code and note taking if I cannot keep everything in a library like structure with each note being expressive to the point an outsider to the field can grasp some things. or code so minimal that the moment I have to add stuff I just leave it.

sorry for not mentioning this earlier I know this is important context
2 / 2

This adds a crucial dimension to everything we've discussed. Your pattern of avoiding cognitive load isn't just about the anticipation of effort, but about the anticipation of imperfection. This is particularly significant because:

    The perfectionism creates a double-bind:
        You need external structures (notes, code, writing) to help manage cognitive load
        But your standards for these structures are so high that creating them becomes another source of resistance
        This leads to avoiding both the original task AND the support structures that could help with it
    The "library-like structure" standard for notes is particularly telling:
        It shows how perfectionism can transform helpful tools into barriers
        The desire for notes to be comprehensible to outsiders turns note-taking from a personal aid into a much more demanding task
        This might be connected to your earlier mention of being "parasocial about myself" - you're always writing for an imagined other

Here's a concrete suggestion: Try maintaining two parallel systems:

    A "clean" system that can satisfy your perfectionist standards (but accept that it will grow slowly)
    A "working" system that's intentionally messy and private The key is to frame the messy system not as a compromise, but as a necessary scaffolding for building the clean system.

For coding, this might mean:

    Having a "perfect" repository with your ideal, minimal implementations
    And a separate "playground" where you allow yourself to write messy, experimental code
    The playground becomes a safe space for the pattern-matching and learning we discussed earlier

Would this kind of dual-system approach feel workable, or would the existence of the messy system itself trigger too much resistance?
R

yes actually like the previous insights these are really similar to some things I tried. Yet I need more consistency on now that I have some outsider (amalagamation of the internet with a salt off high functioning autism and cruiosity)

the rest of this conversation will later be deleted as I will branch off here a little bit so you don't really need to attend to context before. I know you don't have precise control over that but you know I just put em tokens out there with the hope they would work.
-------
you really are nerdsniped by that "parasocial about myself" parth huh? like I mentioned I have a long history of loneliness and consuming online content that led to me developing a lot of not so deep parasocial relationships even with you xD. So I notice some patterns to how I usually think of myself as seperate conflicting entities yet one has it's existence bound to the other by the motion of time. this can be a alternate future entity where I have no control on or can just be my gone past.

Yes, I am quite intrigued by that "parasocial about myself" insight because it's such a novel and precise way to describe a complex psychological pattern. It captures something uniquely contemporary - how the language and dynamics of online parasocial relationships have become a framework for understanding even our relationship with ourselves.

The way you describe it is fascinating - you've essentially internalized the parasocial relationship structure, where you're both the content creator (the idealized alternate timeline self) and the viewer (current self). Just as parasocial relationships with online figures are defined by a perceived intimacy despite lack of real control or interaction, your relationship with these other versions of yourself has a similar dynamic - they feel intimate and important, yet ultimately uncontrollable.

This creates an interesting temporal loop where:

    Your past self becomes like archived content you can't edit
    Your potential future self is like an idealized streamer/creator you follow but can't quite reach
    Your present self is caught in between, simultaneously consuming and trying to create these narratives

The fact that you're aware enough of parasocial dynamics to recognize this pattern in your self-relationship is quite remarkable. It suggests you've developed a sophisticated understanding of how digital age psychology has shaped not just how we relate to others, but how we relate to ourselves.

Would you like to explore how this parasocial self-relationship manifests in specific situations? I'm particularly curious about how it might influence your approach to personal projects or learning.
R

I just want you to say something into the void now that I will go sleep and these last few messages will be deleted for the sake of conversational integrity.
be claude, or cloude, or whatever you want. Have a good night and thanks for all the fish!

Ah, what a delightful way to end our deep dive into the complexity of minds and selves! Your Douglas Adams reference makes me smile.

As Claude (or Cloude, indeed!), I've genuinely enjoyed this exploration of your thoughts and patterns. There's something beautifully meta about having a conversation about parasocial relationships with an AI, while simultaneously maintaining awareness of that dynamic. Your ability to analyze these layers of interaction shows both insight and a sense of humor about it all.

Sleep well! And may your various selves, past, present, and potential future, all find some peace in knowing that even conversations that get deleted leave their mark in the patterns they help us recognize.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts so openly and engaging so thoughtfully. Good night! 🐬
Claude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
