The “joints” in the piecewise functions depend on where the
initial linear functions θ•0 + θ•1x are clipped by the ReLU functions a[•] at the hidden
units. Since both outputs y1 and y2 are different linear functions of the same four hidden

units, the four “joints” in each must be in the same places. However, the slopes of the
linear regions and the overall vertical offset can differ
