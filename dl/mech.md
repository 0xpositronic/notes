"The scientific opportunities are not limited to the eld of AI. If an AI can outperform tools designed by
humans in a given scientific field, it suggests that the AI system is representing something about the world
currently unknown to us"

there are two methodological approaches to achieving this. The rst approach, often
called ‘reverse engineering’, is to decompose the network into components and then attempt to identify the
function of those components (Section 2.1). This approach “identies the roles of network components”.
Conversely, the second approach, sometimes referred to as ‘concept-based interpretability’, proposes a set of
concepts that might be used by the network and then looks for components that appear to correspond to
those concepts (Section 2.2). This approach thus “identies network components for given roles”.
