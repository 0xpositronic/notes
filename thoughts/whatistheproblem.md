it has been well over a year that I started to learn unity for the xth time with catlike coding's unity tutorial. I don't remeber anything. I had motivation and studied for days or maybe weeks. Since then I have spent thousands of hours in bf4, league and twitch. With some periods of productivty on stuff that I do not remember now. I had a dream inspired game idea that I was very excited for. I had a garden robot idea that made me start learning ROS. I had a turing complete phase. I had a llm phase. I had a dl from scratch phase. And much before all this I had more and more phases like shader phase before university.

but none of them continue. And none of them resulted in anything. I am still eager or curious about all of these things. I still find them cool and wish I knew more about them. but still I am emptyhanded with nothing but these attempts piling up behind me none of them usefull. And I have nothing else in my life. No friends or anyone to talk to. No other ambitions than these small bursts of productivity.

So what is wrong with me?
is it just loneliness?
In the ages of 14-16 my most productive period of my life. I wa still alone.
Isolated because of covid. With no school or going out. Yet I felt good I was interested in the same stuff and moved on with a couple of them.
But I remember sometimes not all the times but sometimes being motivated by wanting to show some cool thing to my friends which I never actually ended up doing but there was motivation that came from wanting to be an outlier or the best in my environment. Now that i have seen a lot of successfull and younger people that is no longer a source of motivation as I started to compare myself to everyone in the earth rather then my friends. And I have to do this because I eventually want to be an outlier compared to other top %1 of the people.

But what changed?
is it just loneliness showing it's long term effects.
I certainly believe loneliness is a large problem but it cannot be the only one.
I think there is something deeper that causes all of this motivational dsyfunciton.
Is it because I've gotten my brain too integrated with the games I played and Online content I consumed.

Let me tell you how exactly those bursts of productivity end.
There are 2 types, Extremely short ones, like and hour or at most a day long.
And longer ones that are a couple weeks long but still end before a full month.

Short one ususally ends with me feeling exhausted or overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I see. Which is usually not even much. It is just my brain being lasy and not wanting to think. This makes me feel physically exhausted. or after a short amount of progress or a small success my brain screams "IT'S TIME TO QUIT YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH". This is followed by me quitting laying down taking my phone wathcing videos streams or eating a lot and sleeping or masturabting.
And that marks the end for progress in that day. I never return after quitting once.

The relatively longer periods are a bit more mysterious and these are usually the phases I called out earlier. I do not necceserally know what starts or ends them but the end usually looks like this.
I go through a change in my life like my parents visiting, or leaving my home for a week, or exam week starts, or I get sick, Or I really want to try this new update in a game after seeing videos of it. And then I go into a period where I do not really feel the motivation to study like I did for those past weeks, I say to mysefl "After this break (exam week, family visit etc.) is over I will go back to studying for the things I like No one is forcing me I do them because I like them So I should be able to return" And after the big change perios ends I cannot return to studying and never feel the slight will that kept me going for the past weeks. At that point I am already too invested in what distracted me and start playing videos games or doing other things that I did before my 2 week study period. This is usually followed by a depressive period of mmasturabing my brain with short term rewards until it hists and I feel the need to force myself to study or get back into shape.

While all these cycless are going on there are other major memes that inhabit my cognitive space. Like feeling more preassure to take a responsibility as I am now 20 years old and halfway through collage. The preassure to make money to finish school to pay back to my parents or at least make them proud. Or just being important to somehthing or someone somewhere. Providing value to something other then myself. I believe if I manage to study in better ways I could achieve this but at this point these thought are just preassure points and not motivation sources. 


So what is the problem?
I ignored this question for a while now.
Does it need answering. Do I need to know what it is to solve it?
All I want is to be able to pursue stuff that I like.
Why can't I read a book that I like. Isn't that something everyone does. I mean if they like something they just do it. Why can't I
