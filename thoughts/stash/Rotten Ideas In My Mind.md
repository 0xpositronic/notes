Things that I know that needs to change about me and my life but I keep running away from them.

- #### Healthy body
	I can feel my pulse eating away my life with each heavy pounding of my hearth.
	It works so much to keep this unhealthy body going.
- #### English speaking
	I can read, write and listen comfortably for like 3 years now but I still cannot talk 
	From the tone of my voice to my pronunciation it doesn't get better by not talking.
	And it is far from being understandable.
- #### Loneliness
	With a slight exaggeration I can say I have been alone my whole life.
	Apart from that one friend in the middle school I have not had a single person in my life where we can talk to each other with minimal overhead.
	I do not have a single person that knows me.
	I can only talk to people around me (my family) with the 1% of my personality.
	I want to be myself to someone.
	Somehow I am even lonelier in the internet.
- #### Screen time
	Directly related to Loneliness in both ways
	I am addicted to live streams more than anything else since I had access to unlimited internet.
- #### Masturbation habits
	Since the first time I did it I've been progressively masturbating to more degenerate stuff.
	Every day I feel like a worse person.
	Every time I feel disgusting and guilty.
	I am still unable to reflect on my *masturbation addiction* like I do with video games.
- #### Being mentally weak
	I am affected a lot by what random people say in games, even one word, one way interactions gets stuck in my head.
- #### Age
	I think about the fact that I am 20 a lot
	(this probably doesn't help to you who will be even older when reading this. Don't forget to get scanned for cancer or smthn)

you got this.
