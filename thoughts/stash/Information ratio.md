Geohot talked about the world we live in being harder to understand contributing to mental illnesses in youth

I think we can define an information ratito A / B where;
A = Infromation given to you until you become an adult
B = Infromation required to understand the world around you

As the amount of change in the world increases, sometimes in the form of technology, sometimes in the form of big societal or cultural changes. It becomes harder to be ready for the next big thing.

Like how most of our schools don't teach memetic immunity in the age of memes. Or how are we growing up so finance illiterate into a world we can not even navigate without knowing how to pay taxes, how to manage income, how to invest.

For reasons like this I think the information ratio is getting smaller.
A kid 100 years ago could have learned more things about the world they will be an adult in than a kid today.
