jerk = 3rd derivative of position
     = rate of change in acceleration

minimum jerk law
    biological systems tend to move with minimal change in acceleration
    meaning they minimize jerk in their actions
    can be used to model movements of these systems
    can be used to create smooth movements in robotics
