"Economic growth is not a cure-all, but lack of growth is a kill-all"
"Everything good is downstream of growth"
"Not growing is stagnation, which leads to internal fighting and collapse"

Three sources of growth:
- population -> developed societies depopulate
- natural resource utilization -> Limited
- technology -> only perpetual option

Technological progress -> productivity growth -> how much more we can produce with less input
This causes supply to rise, demand to expand and improving material well being of the entire population.

Free markets are the most effective way to organize technological economy
Prices encode information about supply and demand.
This causes entrepreneurs to seek out high prices as a signal of opportunity to create new wealth by driving those prices down.
"The market economy is a discovery machine, a form of intelligence - an exploratory, evolutionary, adaptive system"
"Markets are an inherently individualistic way to achieve superior collective outcomes"
"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest"
My note: 
	self-interest of the provider is not always good for the buyer. Like a butter company mixing unhealthy ingredients into their product to maximize profit. But when a new producer comes with a more healthier but costly product it takes away some market share from the unhealthy and the customers choosing unhealthy product do so by their own decision. But what if the unhealthiness of a product is never revealed?

People do things for other people for three reasons
- love
