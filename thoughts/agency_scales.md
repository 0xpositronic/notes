what is the bottleneck of humanity?
	biology
	politics
	physics
	...
imagine an alien civilization comes to earth with the goal of  reducing the suffering and increasing the liberty and wellbeing of the life on earth.
what would be their target? we see ourselves, an individual human as the minimal unit of agency of our civilizations.
would the aliens see the same way and try to uplift individuals abilities
or would they see our cells or even proteins that form conplex molecular machinery.
our cells might be suffering as the result of our actions, like eating junk food.
what if the aliens give our cells the ability to live without us to reduce their suffering.
