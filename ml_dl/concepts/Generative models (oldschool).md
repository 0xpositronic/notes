if we define discriminative models as
### $y = f[x, \phi]$

generative model can be defined as
### $x = g[y, \phi]$
generative model has the disadvantage that it doesn't directly predict **y**. To perform inference we have to invert this equation
### $y = g^{-1}[x,\phi]$
this might be difficult but we can build in the methods our data is created into the model.
If we wanted to predict the 3D position and orientation (y) of a car from an image (x) we could build knowledge about car shape, 3D geometry, and light transport into the function $x = g[y,\phi]$



Claude:
1. Why is it a disadvantage that the inverted model doesn't directly predict y?

- Indirect prediction means extra computational steps during inference
- Each inversion might introduce errors or approximations
- Think of it like solving an equation backward: if you have y = 2x, finding x given y is easy. But if you have y = x² + sin(x), finding x given y is much harder

2. Why is it hard to invert the function?

- Many functions are not uniquely invertible (multiple y values could produce the same x)
- For example, in the car case, multiple 3D positions might create very similar 2D images (think of viewing a car from opposite sides)
- The function might involve complex non-linear operations that don't have analytical inverses
- In mathematical terms: $g[y,ϕ]g[y,\phi]g[y,ϕ]$ might not be a bijective function

3. Building in prior knowledge:

- This means encoding domain-specific rules and constraints into the model architecture
- For the car example:
    - You could include 3D geometry equations that describe how objects project onto 2D
    - Include physics-based lighting models
    - Add constraints about valid car shapes and positions
- This helps because:
    - Reduces the space of possible solutions
    - Makes the model more data-efficient
    - Improves generalization to new situations

4. Modern Generative Models:

- No, models like DALL-E and ChatGPT use a different approach
- They're based on transformers and diffusion models that learn patterns directly from data
- Instead of explicitly modeling the generation process, they:
    - Learn statistical patterns from large amounts of data
    - Use techniques like attention and self-supervision
    - Don't typically incorporate explicit domain knowledge in the way described above
- Their "generative" nature comes from learning the probability distribution of the data, rather than modeling the physical generation process

The approach described in your equations is more similar to classical computer graphics or physics-based modeling, where we explicitly model how things are generated in the real world. This can be very powerful for specific problems where we understand the underlying physics/rules well, but is less flexible than modern machine learning approaches that learn patterns directly from data.
