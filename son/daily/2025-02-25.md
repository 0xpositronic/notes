decent day
woke up early but didn't check phone for hours
blocked websites
no gooning
had a mid walk (was boring idk why)
decent-ish progress on mech_interp (still no actual mech interp tho)
got the internship stuff out of the way
found science project for my brother

I should just talk to my brother more
  just with ususal small talk we came make so much progress
  I asked about his science class today and it turns out they were learning about optics.
  And he has to do a science project this year.
  So i talked about the one I made at that exact age and he sounded really fine with it.
  I mean he didn't drop his voice or smthn,
  Maybe because he was delaying studying to talk to me
  I was so scared to make him struggle immediatly to find one RGB led xD
  anyways I gotto sleep this was inexpectedly good



bad things
- no reading
- no taking notes (idk about this one, I have to tidy up existing ones a bit
  and I'm kinda relying on the hope that what I'm learning now will be things I use all the time so maybe I don't have to take notes idk..)
