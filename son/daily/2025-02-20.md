yeah
I talked to my DL prof
  he has no idea about ml I kinda got into the conversation hoping I can get recognition but no results there
  other than that he saod good or non=novel things mostly
  also I keep assuring that I'm even more behind at every way
  it wasnt really a good experience but it's still better than not talking

also finished the gpt2 training video but didn't implement the actual training/dataset/ddp part
  yeah im not really satisfied with that either

talking to dad and brother just made it worse
idk what to think of them
or how to help them
it feels like they are all suffering except mom to some degree



What I learned
  I suck (skill issue)
