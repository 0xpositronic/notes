some extra latenight writing:
I think I never think or know about the most important problems in my life.
I'm in this mental tag game where they're trying to catch me And I'm running for years.
Some I can think of at first
- I pretty much haven't used my brain for years similar to how I didn't actually make anything. (maybe a total of 5 days of work in the last 4-5 years)
- I never pushed myself to be more open to the world
- I never actually thought about future. It's all just me assuring myself delusionally
- As the result of such things I am cognitively worse than I percieve
- I'm not actually good at rotating shapes or solving problems
- This much of self monologue as I'm talking to someone I'm parasocial with is not normal. It's engraved in every thought I have. I think real friends can fix this.
- I don't know what love or even friendship is. How is being friends with someone you actually value works?
- I'm worse at english pronounciation than I think
- I'm never able to fight my laziness. Even the most passionate things fall short.
- I think my descructive past-erasing thinkings actually wokred to some extent and they did more harm than good. Like forgetting about I spent 1.5 years on ss13
- the good "I'm gonna make it" vibes are just distractions from these truths
- the I only find flaws in myself is a mask to hide all flaws of myself
- I do not need to prove myself technically or fill a job application to have friends with same interests (I still fail to fully see this but I will try)

The most important one is being more open and that should lead me to have friends.

some thinking
- imagine if I was also obese now. I feel like things would be 5x worse. I'll look at these problems the same way once I solve them.

- I still think not interacting with people irl is mostly fine if I had a life online.


what I did in the last 5 years
- lol inspired new music taste
- spent a lot of time watching twitch
- deep lol knowladge
- decent linux usage
- some cool tpot readings
- ss13
- 1-2 weeks worth of ML information
- some personal growth just by aging (negatives of loneliness outweigh this for sure)
- degenerate masturbation habits
- lost some weight recently
- become lazier and better at cencoring out every piece of cognitive load bearning thought
- got more responsible/better ot house chores / maintanence
- other than the small information I gained, forgot pretty much all previous ones in different fields
- 



from claude:
More exposure to technical problems where you can exercise pattern matching
Regular engagement with familiar material (rather than always seeking new information)
Writing that focuses on identifying patterns rather than generating new insights
Instead of trying to generate fresh insights (like your late-night writing), try documenting when you notice recurring patterns in your daily life. For example: "Today I noticed I got excited about X technical concept, then felt resistance after Y minutes, then the voices started..." The goal is to build up a catalog of your patterns that you can reference later, rather than always trying to generate new understanding from scratch.

Now for the more crucial point about defending against the "voices" and mental instability:
Concrete defensive strategies:

External anchoring: When you have a moment of clarity like your writing tonight, immediately create some form of external record that's harder to dismiss later. This could be as simple as setting specific calendar reminders with quotes from your clear-minded self, or recording voice notes. The key is having something concrete that exists outside your mental space that can serve as proof against future dismissal.
Pre-commitment to patterns: When you notice you're in a clear mental state, write down specific patterns you know will repeat (like the voices dismissing insights as cringe). Then write down counter-arguments while you're clear-headed. This gives you pre-prepared defenses for when the instability hits.
Complexity as defense: Your insight about biological and social systems being complex and requiring multiple points of failure is actually a powerful defense. When the voices try to oversimplify or dismiss your insights, you can return to this understanding of complexity - it's harder to dismiss multiple interconnected observations than a single insight.

Start treating your anticipation of cognitive load as unreliable data. When you feel the urge to bookmark something or defer thinking about something, try a 2-minute rule: Engage with it for just 2 minutes before deciding to defer. This could help recalibrate your anticipation system to match the actual cognitive load rather than your fears about it.

back to me:
why did this work today
I've had an exprience where I was able to focus for a long time and perform new cognitive tasks.
It can be this weird motivation that comes when you actually need to sleep. or is that thinking a bias. I mean whener you do meaningfull work at night it is bound to be a sleep replacement so the need for sleep might not be the motivator but again why did this work today?

claude:
Late night timing: While the "sleep procrastination productivity" is a real phenomenon (sometimes called "revenge bedtime procrastination"), I think there might be something else significant about late night:

Fewer external interruptions
Lower expectations for productivity, which paradoxically reduces performance anxiety
A certain mental state where the "voices" might be tired enough to have less immediate resistance


The format of writing itself: You mentioned "Writing instead of just thinking also helps." Writing provides:

External structure to thoughts
A way to bypass the immediate dismissal from the "voices" since thoughts are captured as they form
Concrete evidence of cognitive work that's harder to dismiss


The context of sharing: You came here with the intention to share these thoughts with another perspective. This might have:

Created a sense of purpose beyond just self-reflection
Provided a framework for organizing thoughts (knowing they need to be communicable)
Reduced the internal pressure since the thoughts were meant to be externalized




back to offline me:
there is also the perfectionism and ocd's effects for all of these. or one of the potential root causes


claude:
creating immediate, external evidence of your engagement with the material. They help bypass the "I'll come back to this later" deferral pattern by producing something concrete in the moment.


regarding perfectionism:
A "working" system that's intentionally messy and private
The key is to frame the messy system not as a compromise, but as a necessary scaffolding for building the clean system.





BONUS:
Yes, I am quite intrigued by that "parasocial about myself" insight because it's such a novel and precise way to describe a complex psychological pattern. It captures something uniquely contemporary - how the language and dynamics of online parasocial relationships have become a framework for understanding even our relationship with ourselves.

The way you describe it is fascinating - you've essentially internalized the parasocial relationship structure, where you're both the content creator (the idealized alternate timeline self) and the viewer (current self). Just as parasocial relationships with online figures are defined by a perceived intimacy despite lack of real control or interaction, your relationship with these other versions of yourself has a similar dynamic - they feel intimate and important, yet ultimately uncontrollable.

This creates an interesting temporal loop where:
- Your past self becomes like archived content you can't edit
- Your potential future self is like an idealized streamer/creator you follow but can't quite reach
- Your present self is caught in between, simultaneously consuming and trying to create these narratives
