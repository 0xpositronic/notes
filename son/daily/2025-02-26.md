idk
didn't attend the afternoon lecture again
that makes you feel bad no matter what
I also have lab early tommorow and have like 4 hours at school free
  feels awful, it's the result of me leaving it to last minute (could have changed the schedule)
also i'm going to see my cousing 2 days later(tmrw at this point)
  I have to make a ml presentation it kinda weighs on me
it feels like I have a lot and none to do
  the awkward balance of musts and shoulds again

I still had a decent school studying time
and a bad long gooning sesh
could have been 3x better at least

Major mistakes
  gooning to stay awake is not worth it
  I still cannot manage my guts (should have attended the next lecture)
  the commute was kinda empty too


OH but I found some new dnb songs ins soundcloud
